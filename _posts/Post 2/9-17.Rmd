## Brainstorming for the final paper

My plan at the moment is to write a general review/overview on sound in the context of memory and learning for the purpose of proposing a guide on **cognitive sound design for educational multimedia**.

Some possible topics that could be covered include:

###	[1] Designing audio for **_memory_**
* Phonetic processing, acoustic encoding of memory, rehearsal
* Echoic memory
* Dual-coding theory (voiceover, contextual sound effects)
* Music arousal when learning vs working memory capacity (and simplicity of task)
* Appropriate mood state-dependent cues. For music, emotional judgments may be cultural but also psychophysical
* Prior cultural experiences with music affect expectation

###	[2] Designing audio for **_attention_**
* Cognitive load theory
* Split-attention
* Pairing with images, on-screen text, subtitles
* Cueing via contextual sound design
* Music as an attentional aid 
* Familiarity in music & speech
* Building expectation in patterns, e.g., rhythm
* Audio masking, precedence effect, attentional capture / cocktail party effect
* Background sounds as distraction (though background music or white noise may promote stochastic resonance to benefit listeners with ADHD)

###	[3] Designing audio for **_motivation_**
* Audio as immediate performance feedback
* Audio as reward (musicality, speech)

### Maybe also include: 
* Linguistic background can affect development of music and sound cognition (e.g., tonal or pitch accented L1 may promote significantly earlier development of pitch discrimination in childhood)
* Audio accessibility for learners with disabilities

# Alternatively
* Proposal for a study re: effects of contextual audio feedback on ability to recall meaning in a foreign language vocabulary training application
* Proposal for a study re: effects of characteristics of background music (e.g., melodic complexity, harmonic complexity, arrangement, tempo, presence/language of lyrics, frequency content, dynamic range) on working memory load
