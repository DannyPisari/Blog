    "contents": "\nBrainstorming for the final paper\nMy plan at the moment is to write a general review/overview on sound in the context of memory and learning for the purpose of proposing a guide on cognitive sound design for educational multimedia.\nSome possible topics that could be covered include:\n[1] Designing audio for memory\nPhonetic processing, acoustic encoding of memory, rehearsal\nEchoic memory\nDual-coding theory (voiceover, contextual sound effects)\nMusic arousal when learning vs working memory capacity (and simplicity of task)\nAppropriate mood state-dependent cues. For music, emotional judgments may be cultural but also psychophysical\nPrior cultural experiences with music affect expectation\n[2] Designing audio for attention\nCognitive load theory\nSplit-attention\nPairing with images, on-screen text, subtitles\nCueing via contextual sound design\nMusic as an attentional aid\nFamiliarity in music & speech\nBuilding expectation in patterns, e.g., rhythm\nAudio masking, precedence effect, attentional capture / cocktail party effect\nBackground sounds as distraction (though background music or white noise may promote stochastic resonance to benefit listeners with ADHD)\n[3] Designing audio for motivation\nAudio as immediate performance feedback\nAudio as reward (musicality, speech)\nMaybe also include:\nLinguistic background can affect development of music and sound cognition (e.g., tonal or pitch accented L1 may promote significantly earlier development of pitch discrimination in childhood)\nAudio accessibility for learners with disabilities\nAlternatively\nProposal for a study re: effects of contextual audio feedback on ability to recall meaning in a foreign language vocabulary training application\nProposal for a study re: effects of characteristics of background music (e.g., melodic complexity, harmonic complexity, arrangement, tempo, presence/language of lyrics, frequency content, dynamic range) on working memory load\n\n\n\n",
